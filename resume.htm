      <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3><hr />
      <h4>Studying</h4>
      <p>I study a varied spectrum of subjects, and my primary objective is not to be master of, but to have a moderate level of understanding on those subjects, so that at least I can communicate with the experts. The subjects cover from Philosophy, Psychology, Politics, Medical-Biology, Brain and Cognition to Constructed Languages, Religions, Mythology, Comics et al.</p>
      <h4>Photography</h4>
      <p>I suffer from equipment deficiency disorder. But that apart, I mostly do macro-shots with controlled depth of field, color-tuned longshot landscapes, panorama, spontaneous and still life. Have interests in experimental photography; High-Speed/Long-Exposure/Time-Lapse, Infrared/Ultraviolet, HDR are my favorites. <a href="http://gilad.deviantart.com/gallery/" target="_blank" title="DeviantART Gallery of Gilad Benari">Gilad Benari</a> is my most admired photographer.</p>
      <h4>Computer Gaming</h4>
      <p>Action/adventure, puzzle/platforming, stealth/shooter &amp; arcade racing are my favourite genre of video games. I'm a fan of Prince of Persia, Need for Speed, Splinter Cell, Call of Duty series and all the games that Crytek GmbH has developed so far.</p>
      <h4>Re-organizing Myself</h4>
      <p>The most important thing (to me), that I do when stuck having a leisure time (long-journey, powercuts), is to sort out my objectives, strategy, necessities, achievements etc. I critique myself and reform accordingly.</p>
      <h4>Troubleshooting Systems</h4>
      <p>Being the tech-guru among the friends, and the friends of the friends (and their relatives), I (used to) spend a lot of time solving their technical issues, which I'd like to add in my hobbies. Most of my first tier friends growing technically strong now a days, I miss this hobby a little, now a days.</p>

    <p>I appreciate your effort to review my resume. If you still feel like I'm a suitable match, most probably I am - if you feel I'm not a suitable candidate for you, then I'm most definitely not.</p>
    <p>This standalone HTML file comes without any external dependancy or codes. It's designed &amp; layed out completely with HTML5 elements (no TABLE, not even DIVs have been used), maintained with version controlling system and is updated frequently; if you find any mistake, want to propose upgrades or think that something should be added/discarded, I'd be eager to know.</p>
