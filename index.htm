      <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3><hr />
      <h4>Studying</h4>
      <p>I study a varied spectrum of subjects, so that at least I can communicate with the experts of those topics. The subjects cover from Philosophy, Psychology, Politics, Medical-Biology, Brain and Cognition to Constructed Languages, Religions, Mythology, Comics et al.</p>
      <h4>Photography</h4>
      <p>I mostly do macro-shots with controlled depth of field, color-tuned longshot landscapes, panorama, spontaneous and still life. Have interests in experimental photography; High-Speed/Long-Exposure/Time-Lapse, Infrared/Ultraviolet, HDR are my favorites. <a href="http://gilad.deviantart.com/gallery/" target="_blank" title="DeviantART Gallery of Gilad Benari">Gilad Benari</a> is my most admired photographer.</p>
      <h4>Computer Gaming</h4>
      <p>Action/adventure/platforming, stealth/shooter &amp; arcade-racing are my favorite genres of video games. I'm a fan of Prince of Persia, Need for Speed, Splinter Cell, Call of Duty series and all the games developed by Crytek GmbH.</p>
      <h4>Miscellaneous Whimsy</h4>
      <p>I have built, managed and directed an amateur theater group and successfully performed, as well as cricket team etc. I was renowned for participating in seminars, exhibitions and other extracurricular-activities. Being the tech-guru among the friends, I (used to) spend a lot of time solving their technical issues. The another important thing I do when stuck having a leisure time (long-journey, power-cuts), is to sort out my objectives, strategy, necessities, achievements etc. I critique myself and reform accordingly.</p>
